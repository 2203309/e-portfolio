                <h3>Food Printing System</h3>
                <h4>RSE3106 Systems Engineering Project 2</h4>
                <p><strong>Project Overview:</strong></p>
                <p>Our project began with an in-depth exploration of food printing systems, specifically focusing on both 3D and 2D food printers. The 3D food printers operate by extruding food materials through a nozzle, which moves along X-Y-Z axes to create intricate shapes and structures. On the other hand, 2D food printers, akin to traditional inkjet printers, deposit food-grade inks onto flat surfaces, creating detailed images and patterns. Initially, our goal was to enhance the capabilities of these systems to offer more customization in terms of food shape, color, and texture. However, as we delved deeper into the technology, we realized there was a significant, unaddressed need: making product information accessible to visually impaired individuals, who often struggle with reading small print on packaging.</p>
                <p>Identifying this gap, we transitioned our focus towards developing a solution that could leverage food printing technology to improve accessibility. We began by researching existing solutions like Braille embossers and NaviLens. Braille embossers elevate surfaces to create tactile text readable by touch, while NaviLens uses visual codes that can be scanned by smartphones to provide audio descriptions. Both systems have their strengths; Braille offers tactile feedback and enhanced memory retention without the need for digital devices, making it highly effective for visually impaired individuals. However, it requires specialized equipment and skills to produce. NaviLens, while user-friendly and capable of storing vast amounts of information, is smartphone-dependent, which might not be convenient or accessible for everyone.</p>
                <p>To integrate the best aspects of these existing solutions into our food printing systems, we explored three main concepts: thermal ink, UV curable ink, and binder inkjet technology. Thermal ink involves the use of heat to cure the printed material, ensuring durability and tactile feedback similar to Braille embossing. However, the addition of heat posed potential risks of damaging food products, making this method less viable. UV curable ink presented a promising alternative, using ultraviolet light to cure the material quickly. This method required modifications to the printing system, such as incorporating UV light sources, and raised concerns about potential chemical residues on food. Finally, binder inkjet technology, which involves using a binding agent to solidify printed materials, showed the most promise. By carefully controlling the binder and material interactions, we could achieve the desired tactile feedback and precision required for Braille text, while maintaining the safety and integrity of the food products. This method also allowed us to leverage existing food printing infrastructure with minimal modifications.</p>
