								<p>Since young, I've enjoyed doing hands-on activities and dismantling things to understand how various pieces fit. Because of this, I developed an interest in engineering, where I could learn about the production and application of systems in our daily lives. During my secondary school years, the Design and Technology course that I took sparked an even greater interest in the field of engineering for me. Because I had a strong preference for mathematics and physics, as well as a strong interest in mechanisms, I decided to enrol in the diploma in Automation and Mechatronics System at Ngee Ann Polytechnic, where I believed I would be able to learn more about multiple system components.</p>
								<p>Studying at Ngee Ann Polytechnic has provided me with the opportunity to gain a better understanding of the automation industry and its various sectors. I was fortunate to have the opportunity to work with robots and control their movements using Python and C++ programming. Ngee Ann had also provided me with the opportunity to work as an intern at Molex, where I was able to put my theoretical knowledge into practice. In Molex, I was tasked with digitalising one of Molex's operations, which had previously been carried out entirely by hand. I was able to create a software system for Molex to use through the use of Microsoft Excel, Power Automate, and Python, and I am proud to say that this system is still in use to this very day.</p>
								<p>During my time in Molex and Ngee Ann Polytechnic, I discovered that the automation industry is about beyond just gears and production lines; it is also about programming and data analysis, among other things. As a result, I am currently studying in SIT for Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Robotics Systems. I believe that during my time at SIT, I will be able to further my knowledge and, as a result, make a difference in the automation industry in the future.</p>
